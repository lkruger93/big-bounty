# cpnt260-final
my awesome repository for my awesome final project for the awesome course cpnt260.

this was made all by me so everything is totally fine for me to use.
I did everything from take the photos to resizing them all so they all had the same dimensions for those in the gallery and contact page.
I also used figma to create a logo as an SVG and insert it in.
The struggle I realized at the end when i tried to open the site on my phone was that all the media queries i'd done only worked for desktop and not an actual phone screen.  I realized I had to use @media screen and (max-device-width: 600px) in order for it to make a difference on mobile.  Even so, there are still some differences between the two that would take a lot more effort to figure out.  My favourite part of this was making it horsey themed.  I think one day when I become rich it would be awesome to own a bunch of horses and be able to do cool websites like this for real horsey businesses.
